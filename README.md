Run Everything Locally
===========

To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you've installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) â‰¥ 12

2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`

3. Follow the instructions for [rainbow-bridge-cli](https://github.com/near/rainbow-bridge-cli) to run an Ethereum network, a NEAR network, and the bridge all locally

4. Run [near-contract-helper](https://github.com/near/near-contract-helper) locally on the default port (3000)

5. Run [near-wallet](https://github.com/near/near-wallet) locally ([this PR](https://github.com/near/near-wallet/pull/861) streamlines it). Run it on port 4000 & set node's `--max-http-header-size` to `16000` (default is 8kb):
